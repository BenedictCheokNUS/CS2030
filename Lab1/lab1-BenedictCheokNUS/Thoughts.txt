Thought flow about the entire shop simulation process.

File Name: ShopSimulation.java
Description: 
ShopSimulation.java is in charge of:
First --> Initialising the Shop (Open Shop) by telling the shop owner (Shop)...
    1. Number of Counters to Set Up.
    2. Number of Customers for that day (or that run)
    3. Arrival Time of the customers
    4. Service Time needed for each customer
    
    The Shop will prepare the counters and "arrange the timing" with the customers.
    i.e. the Shop will initialise the customers.
    The Shop Owner will then return the list of available counters --> {true, true, true, false}
    
Second --> Prepare the list of initial events that will occur (all the arrival events).
